# Assembl: Assemble Talent, Achieve Greatness

## Overview

**Assembl** is a web application designed to help students easily find teammates for hackathons, challenges, and group projects. The platform connects individuals with complementary skills, ensuring that teams are well-balanced and aligned in terms of expertise. By creating a space where users can search for and collaborate with peers based on skill sets, availability, and project requirements, Assembl helps maximize the learning and creativity of students while minimizing the challenges associated with team formation.

## Key Features

- **Skill-Based Search**: Allows users to search for teammates with specific skills, such as web development, design, product building, business pitching, etc.
- **Availability Matching**: Matches teammates based on their availability, ensuring smooth collaboration and scheduling.
- **Role Recommendations**: Suggests the most suitable roles for team members based on their experience and skill set.
- **Project Dashboard**: A centralized place for users to manage their projects, track progress, and communicate with teammates.
- **Collaboration & Communication Tools**: Includes features like chat, video calls, and document sharing to facilitate efficient teamwork.
- **Peer Review System**: Users can rate each other after completing projects, helping future collaborators make informed decisions.
- **Skill Profiling**: Allows students to create detailed profiles showcasing their skills, experience, and completed projects.
  
## How It Works

1. **Create an Account**: Users sign up and create a profile, listing their skills, interests, and availability.
2. **Search for Teammates**: Browse a list of potential teammates or search based on specific skills and project needs.
3. **Team Formation**: Users can invite potential teammates to form a team, ensuring a mix of skills and availability that aligns with their project goals.
4. **Collaborate**: Once the team is formed, users can manage tasks, communicate, and track progress all within the app.
5. **Feedback**: After completing a project or hackathon, teammates can leave feedback to help others improve and make better decisions for future collaborations.
